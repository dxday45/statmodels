This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

For this we will be using the Evans County data.  Load the mosaic and dplyr packages and EvansCounty.csv into R, and then change the name to data

```{r}
library(mosaic)
library(dplyr)
data = EvansCounty
```

Confidence Interval for a mean
Point Estimate
```{r}
mean.AGE <- mean(data$AGE)
mean.AGE
```

standard CI calculation

```{r}
sd.AGE <- sd(data$AGE)
sd.AGE
```
```{r}
#Margin of Error
Margin.of.Error <- 1.96*sd.AGE/sqrt(nrow(data))
```
```{r}
#Lower and Upper Limits
Lower <- mean.AGE - Margin.of.Error
Upper <- mean.AGE + Margin.of.Error
Lower
Upper
```

Bootstrap CI
Sample from AGE with replacement, and find the mean of the resampled values
```{r}
xxx <- resample(data$AGE)
mean(xxx)
```
Let's repeat this process a large number of times and look at the distribution
```{r}
xxx <- do(1000)*mean(resample(data$AGE))
hist(xxx$mean)
```

to find the upper and lower confidence limits, we find the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles (for 95% CI)
```{r}
quantile(xxx$mean,probs=c(0.025,0.975))
```
compare these to the lower and upper limits we found earlier
```{r}
Lower
Upper
```

CI for the median
Suppose we want to estimate the median
```{r}
median(data$AGE)
```

Let's generate the 95% bootstrap CI
```{r}
xxx <- do(10000)*median(resample(data$AGE))
histogram(xxx$median)
quantile(xxx$median,probs=c(0.025,0.975))
```


CI for the difference between two means
Suppose we wanted to compare the average age of smokers and non-smokers
```{r}
mean(AGE~SMK,data=data)
diff(mean(AGE~SMK,data=data))
```
It looks like smokers are about 2.7 years older on average
To create the 95% CI for this difference, we resample within each group, and then find the differences between the means of the groups.  And repeat the process a large number of times.  Once we have the distribution, we can find the the upper and lower confidence limits as we did before
```{r}
x <- data %>% filter(SMK==1) %>% select(AGE) #create smoker subgroup
y <- data %>% filter(SMK==0) %>% select(AGE) #create non-smoker subgroup

mean(y$AGE)-mean(x$AGE) #difference between the means of non-smokers and smokers

xxx <- do(10000)*(mean(resample(y)$AGE)-mean(resample(x)$AGE))  #bootstrap process

histogram(xxx$result)

quantile(xxx$result,probs=c(0.025,0.975))  #lower and upper limits
```
